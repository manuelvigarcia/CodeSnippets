You are given an array of integers of size N. You need to print the sum of the elements in the array, keeping in mind that some of those integers may be quite large.

Input Format

The first line of the input consists of an integer N. The next line contains N space-separated integers contained in the array.

Output Format

Print a single value equal to the sum of the elements in the array.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10
0 <= A[i] <= 10^10


Sample Input 
5
100000000001 100000000002 100000000003 100000000004 100000000005

Sample Output
500000000015

The range of int is -2^31 to 2^31 - 1.

When we add several integer values, the resulting sum might exceed the range. You need to use long.
